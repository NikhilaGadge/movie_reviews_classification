a leoni ) , a reporter for msnbc . \\nshe gets handed a job to investigate a possible cover-up in the government involving senator alan rittenhouse ( james cromwell ) . \\nshe talks to a woman who mentions that rittenhouse was having an affair with a girl named ellie . \\nafter talking with rittenhouse , and unsatisfied with the information she gets , she decides to use the internet for help . \\nluckily , she knows exactly how to spell the certain \" ellie \" that she is looking for ( they spell it ele in the film . . . \\nthat girl is pretty darn smart for guessing how it was spelled ) . \\nbefore she can use the information , the government decides to push her car off the road . \\nthey take her in to meet the president of the united states , president beck ( morgan freeman ) . \\nbeck recommends that jenny keep the information secret for 48 hours so they can confirm it and then hold a press conference . \\nnaturally , she wants to be compensated , and they offer her a front row seat and the chance for the first question . \\nand so , yada yada yada , they reveal the comet to the public and their plans : send a massive spacecraft out to destroy it before it can arrive . \\nthey announce a plan called \" ark , \" which is their only hope for survival . \\na computer will select 800 , 000 people at random . \\nthese people are the ones who will go into a large cave underground so that the impact of the comet won\\'t kill off the entire human race . \\nafter two years , the dust will settle ( actually , it would take much , much longer--approximately ninety years , from what i understand ) and the humans could come back to the surface and start over . \\nthe rest of the plot is your standard disaster film procedures , but there is one subplot worth mentioning . \\njenny and her father , jason ( maximilian schell ) , have a very touching relationship that forms out of the impending doom . \\nthe final moment involving the two characters is heartfelt and emotional . \\nit\\'s a shame that nothing else is heartfelt . \\nnow , of course , we all know that the comet does impact the surface . \\nthe title alone suggests it , and the previews actually show it ! \\nby doing this , absoltuely no tension can be drawn from any attempt to stop the comet because we all know that it won\\'t work . \\ndirector mimi leder came from her successful tries at direction with episodes of the hit television show \" er . \" \\nher major film debut was the peacemaker , a pathetic and heartless action film . \\nwell , this time leder outdid herself , creating a film worse than that one . \\nsuggestion to ms . leder : please , stay away from the big screen , or at least the action genre . \\nmuch of the blame can be placed on leder directly , because the pace is disastrously off . \\nthroughout the film we are given subtitles that tell us how much time has passed ( it goes from months to weeks to hours ) . \\nit literally feels like this lapsed time is taking place in real-time--it\\'s that boring . \\nof course , leder isn\\'t all to blame for it . \\nscreenwriters michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin have crafted a simplistic story that only gets worse with time . \\nwhat starts out promising soon turns deadly ( for the audience anyway ) . \\nchock full of cheesy one liners ( \" you know , you are going to have more sex than anyone else in school ! \" ) \\nand stupid characters , you might think we were back in the 70s again . \\nonly one of the subplots is remotely interesting , while the rest are forgettable and boring . \\nand the main plot is so outrageous that you can\\'t figure out if this film is supposed to be an action , drama , or sci-fi . \\nto put it simply : the special effects of this film are a hit and miss situation . \\nthat\\'s right , 80% miss , and 20% hit . \\nscenes above the earth are well done , and the orbiting ship is majestic . \\nbut the comet is a huge mistake , making it more laughable than frightening . \\nthe concept of even trying to land on a comet is preposterous enough , but that\\'s forgiveable . \\nwhat isn\\'t forgiveable is actually having humans walk on the surface . \\ngive me a break , will ya ? \\nand of course , the much hyped collision of comet and earth . \\nwell , it is far from spectacular , and it makes independence day look brilliant . \\nthe water rushing towards the land is effective , but once it hits the continent , the effects turn ridiculous . \\ncgi water is used , and it looks so bad that i heard more laughs from the audience than shrieks . \\nin fact , i may even recommend the film for those who want to see how bad effects can actually get these days . \\njust when we think visual effects can\\'t be improved , along comes a film to show that they really can and should be . \\none thing has struck a wrong note with me concerning mimi leder\\'s direction , which also influences the actors . \\nleder loves to show the actors\\' faces before and during moments of terror . \\nthis reminded me of another action director , renny harlin ( die hard 2 , cliffhanger ) . \\nbut harlin succeeds because he shows the faces of the victims in realistic situations . \\nleder likes to flaunt people\\'s fears via their faces , but instead of coming off as sympathetic , leder seems more of a sadist . \\none moment has an astronaut flying off into space . \\nthis should be enough to warrant a response from the audience , but leder wants to go farther and shows us the person\\'s face while drifting into space . \\nthis is one of the cheapest ways to ellicit an emotional response from an audience , and i , for one , am not going to be fooled . \\non another note , leder\\'s film only picks up its pace during the last fifteen minutes when the comet actually impacts . \\nthe pace does pick up , and some very emotional moments are shown . \\nthen again , when you watch people cry for their loved ones , it\\'s obvious it will be emotional . \\nit\\'s mostly just a big trick to rope viewers into \" feeling \" for the characters , but it didn\\'t work for me . \\nbut anyway , the actors do as much as they can with what they are given . \\nt ? a leoni ( bad boys , tv\\'s \" the naked truth \" ) is the best of the film , and she is given the meatiest role . \\nher character is made stronger by leoni\\'s presence , and we grow to care for her . \\nrobert duvall is energetic and fun to watch , but his character is turned into shreds by the plot . \\nelijah wood also comes off rather successfully , but he still hasn\\'t had many good roles ( wood , stick to drama ! \\nyou are too talented for this stuff ) . \\nvanessa redgrave is barely acknowledgeable , and her performance is only enhanced by her strong presence on screen . \\nmaximilian schell is distracting , but he does provide some nice humor . \\nmorgan freeman has been infinitely better than this , and gives one of his most shallow performances to date ( which is quite remarkable for him ) . \\nleelee sobieski could have been better , but i think she just suffered from a poorly written character . \\na special note should go to ron eldard and denise crosby . \\neldard is good in his role , but is limited by the plot . \\ncrosby is special to me personally because she was tasha yar from tv\\'s \" star trek : the next generation . \" \\nseeing her was one of the highlights of the film . \\noverall , a very talented cast virtually wasted . \\ndeep impact is rated pg-13 for disaster related elements and brief language . \\nthis is one of the worst films of the year , and if it is any omen of things to come , this summer could be one of the worst ever . \\nluckily , the x-files movie is coming up , and hopefully armageddon will be more successful . \\nit\\'s a shame that this film will do so successfully because it just isn\\'t worth much . \\ncosting nearly $75 million , with special effects done by the illustrious ilm ( which is a huge shocker ) , and with a score composed by oscar-winner james horner ( titanic ) , one might have expected this to be more fun to witness and experience . \\nwell , it\\'s not . \\nwhen the comet does hit the earth , you almost wish it could just take this film along with it . \\n',\n",
